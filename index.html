<h1>Lupetea Langi</h1>

<h2>Year 11 2023</h2>
<p>Greetings I am Ulukilupetea Meleane 'Ofa Ki Karaka 'O Niusila Langi. However I would prefer to be called Lupetea or Lupe for short, as it is easier to pronouce and simpler to remember. I'm a female born 15/2/2008, which is known as the year of the rat. My country of origin is Tonga which is located in the South Pacific Ocean. My family and I immigrated to New Zealand in the year 2014 so it is reasonable to say that English is not my first language. I was at Timaru Christian School for 10 years of my life, 6 years of primary, 2 years of intermidiate and 2 years of highschool. This is my first year at Craighead Diocesan School ad I am a year 11.I come from quite a big family, as I am the eldest of 5, two sisters and two brothers.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Guitar playing</li>
  <li> Science specifically Biology</li>
  <li> Ukele playing</li>
  <li> Listening to Music</li>
